# kilvish

An app to better manage & track your expenses

## Getting Started

1. Setup Flutter on your PC
   - [Download flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
   - [Setup Editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
   - Run `flutter doctor` in your PC terminal to figure out anything that flutters need that is not installed on your PC
2. Run code
   - `flutter pub get` to install dependencies. Your editor will do it by default once you have cloned the repository & opened it in the editor
   - `flutter run` will launch the app in debug mode. You can also launch it from Run command of your editor.
